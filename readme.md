#### Disclaimer.

You need to rename the Chevy Tahoe to `sheriff2`.
I have only made the skins.
I have changes so it you can use all-blue for the vehicles.
All credit goes to the original creators.
I recommend to use Modding DLC Pack V (https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/modding-dlc-pack-v) for easy install.
You need ELS V (https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/13865-emergency-lighting-system/) or for FiveM you need ELS-FiveM (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-els-fivem-server-sync-lights-sirens-custom-patterns/64048).
